## Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>

Welcome to the Jupyter Grading System – where coding meets the future of education! This ingenious system revolutionizes the grading experience for Jupyter notebooks, transforming the tedious into the extraordinary.

## Built With <a name="built-with"></a>

- **Python**
- **Selenium**
- **Chromium-Chromedriver**
- **PrePost SEO API**

### Algorithms Used

#### Regression Algorithms

- **Code Quality Analysis:** Picture a discerning code guru examining your code – that’s what this regression model does! It evaluates code complexity, variable naming, docstring presence, and adherence to best practices.

- **Documentation Style Analysis:** Another digital Sherlock Holmes! This regression model investigates your documentation, analyzing clarity, completeness, and the elegance of your explanations in markdown cells.

#### Plagiarism Detection API

- **External API Magic:** No need to reinvent the wheel. We've integrated a powerful external API for plagiarism detection. Just sit back, relax, and let the API work its magic!

## Prerequisites <a name="prerequisites"></a>

Before diving into the coding adventure, make sure you have your essentials ready:

- **Python**
- **Required Python Packages (`selenium`)**
- **Chromium-Chromedriver**

## Getting Started <a name="getting-started"></a>

1. **Install Required Packages:** Use `pip install selenium` to get the necessary packages.
2. **Chromium-Chromedriver Setup:** Execute `apt-get install chromium-chromedriver` for Chromium-Chromedriver goodness.
3. **Clone, Customize, Conquer:** Clone the repository and tailor the code to your liking.
4. **Follow the Module Map:** Each module has instructions to guide you through configuration and execution. Easy peasy!

## Usage <a name="usage"></a>

Unlock the true power of the Jupyter Grading System! It’s designed for educators seeking to elevate the grading process. Dive into the modules, unleash the algorithms, and provide students with next-level feedback.

## Features <a name="features"></a>

- **Web Scraping Awesomeness:** Harvesting data from the web? Check!
- **Code Execution Analysis:** Peeking into the soul of your code? Double-check!
- **Algorithm Performance Evaluation:** Assessing algorithms? Triple-check!
- **Explanability, Task, and Style Analysis:** For a 360-degree view of your project.
- **Plagiarism Check with API Magic:** Because why do it yourself when there's an API for that?
- **Faculty Dashboard Delight:** Visualizations for the win!
- **Comprehensive Feedback Generation:** Because we believe in constructive criticism!

## Algorithm <a name="algorithm"></a>

Explore the inner workings of our genius algorithms. It's not just coding; it's a symphony of logical brilliance!

## Data <a name="data"></a>

The system extracts data from carefully curated URLs, focusing on Python, data analysis, and machine learning. Don’t forget to customize the `urls` list according to your desires.

## Disclaimer <a name="disclaimer"></a>

This system is a digital sidekick, but it may need some costume changes (code customization) for specific missions. Use responsibly.

## Feedback <a name="feedback"></a>

Feedback is the secret sauce. It’s generated based on a secret blend of criteria – providing valuable insights for both students and faculty members.

## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

To bring this magic to life, install the necessary dependencies with `pip install selenium`. Don’t forget to set up Chromium-Chromedriver for the full experience.
